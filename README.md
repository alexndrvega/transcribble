# Transcribble

Before we get started, it's important to note that the script requires certain dependencies to be installed. You can find a list of these dependencies in the requirements.txt file, which should be installed prior to running the script.

## Using the python script is a straightforward process that involves the following steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies using the requirements.txt file.
2. Open the app.py file in your preferred code editor.
3. Specify the path to the .mp3 file that you want to transcribe.
4. Input your OpenAI API key.
5. Run the script and wait for it to complete.

It's important to note that the script currently only supports .mp3 audio files. Other audio formats are not currently supported.

The output generated by the script is in JSON format. The JSON output includes information such as the transcription text, the confidence score, and the start and end times for each word in the transcription.
